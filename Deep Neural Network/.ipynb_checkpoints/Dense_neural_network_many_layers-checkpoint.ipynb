    "The following notebook describes the implementation of a deep neural network for binary classification task using numpy library and python dictionaries. Deep Learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning in recent times with applications in the area of Computer Vision, Natual Language Processing, Sequence modeling etc. Neural networks are highly complex data structures and can be expensive to train due to the large number of parameters involved. Neural networks are another class of optimization problems similar to least square regression and maximum liklihood estimates which are used in various classification algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "   A dense neural network is one of the most generic type of neural network with all the nodes in one layer connected to  all the other nodes in the next layer and so on. Dense neural networks are well suited for non linear problems due to the non-linear nature of the activation functions used and dense connections between nodes. The figure below shows the architecture a dense deep neural network with 3 layers and many nodes in each layer used for the binary classification task. Please refer *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow et al.\n",

    "$W's$ are the network weight matrices and $b's$ are the bias terms. In this implementation the bias is a vector instead of a single number for each layer. $Z$ represents the linear transformation of the input data and $A$ is the activation function applied to the linear transformation. The activation functions implemented in this investigation are Sigmoid, Rectified Linear Unit(RELU), Leaky RELU and tanh. Since this is a binary classification task, the final node always uses the sigmoid activation function whose output varies between zero and 1 - which then can be used for predicting the binary class labels. The values of the elements in the weight matrices and bias vectors need to be fit for making accurate predictions based on the training set. A loss function is defined and minimization of the loss function using gradient descent optimization algorithm is performed. The loss function is give as follows,\n",

The dot in the above equations represent matrix multiplication. In the above figure $n_{0}$ represents the number of features in the $X$ matrix and $m$ is the number of training examples. THe weight matrix in the first layer $W_{1}$ is of size $(n_1,n_0)$ and feature matrix X is of size $(m,n_0)$. So feature matrix need to be transposed before performing the dot product. The resulting $Z^1$ is of size $(n_1,m)$. The activation matrix $A^1$ is calculated by applying the activation function to each element of the $Z^1$ matrix so it has the same dimensions. For the next layer the linear combination matrix $Z^2$ is calculated using $A^1$, weight matrix $W_2$ and the bias vector $b_2$. The activation matrix $A^2$ is calculated by using the activation function for the layer. This transformation again changes the dimensions and the value of incoming data. This process is continued until the last layer with the prediction of the probability of binary class label using the sigmoid activation function. "

    "2. *add_layer* - Function for adding layers to the neural network architecture. Takes 2 argument viz., no. of nodes in each layer and the activation function for the layer. The choices for the activation functions are *sigmoid, tanh, RELU and leakyRELU*\n",
    "3. *nn_compile* - This function tries to mimic the compilation step used in the TensorFlow except here there is no actual compilation , but initialization of all the weight (random) and bias matrices. \n",
    "4. *fit* -  This function incorporates the forward and backward propagation of the gradient descent algorithm.It takes in number of epochs (number of iterations of gradient descent) and a learning rate\n",

    "6. *predict* - The predict functions calculates and returns the probability and the class label for a new data input.\n",

    "In this norebook, a deep learning neural network was successfully developed from scratch using only python dictionaries and numpy arrays for binary classification task. Traditional gradient descent aglorithm was used for fitting the weights and biases. A systematic approach was followed for creating the python class with definition of data structures followed by member functions which act on these structures. The process of training and testing the network is very similar to the TensorFlow Keras API. The next steps are to test the model against more datasets and see its performance and to develop a framework for productionizing the model (saving and deploying). These will be explored in a future work."
