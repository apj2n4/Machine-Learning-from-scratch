    "The following notebook describes the implementation of a deep neural network for binary classification task using numpy library and python dictionaries. Deep Learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning in recent times with applications in the area of Computer Vision, Natual Language Processing, Sequence modeling etc. Neural networks are expensive to train due to the number of parameters involved.\n",

    "   A dense neural network is one of the most generic type of neural networks with all the nodes from one layer connected to all the nodes in the next layer and so on. Dense neural networks are well suited for non linear problems due to the non-linear nature of the activation functions used and dense connections between nodes. The figure below shows a dense deep neural network with 3 layers and many nodes in each layer.\n",

    "$W's$ are the network weight matrices and $b's$ are the bias terms. In this implementation the bias is a vector instead of a single number for each layer. $Z$ represents the linear transformation of the input data and $A$ is the activation function applied to the linear transformation. The activation functions implemented in this investigation are Sigmoid, Rectified Linear Unit(RELU), Leaky RELU and tanh. Since this is a binary classification task, the final node always uses the sigmoid activation function whose output varies between zero and 1 - which then can be used for predicting the binary class labels. The values of the elements in the weight matrices and bias vectors need to be fit for making accurate predictions based on the training set. A loss function is defined and minimization of the loss function using gradient descent optimization algorithm is performed. The loss function is give as follows,\n",

The dot in the above equations represent matrix multiplication. In the above figure $n_{0}$ represents the number of features in the $X$ matrix and $m$ is the number of training examples. THe weight matrix in the first layer $W_{1}$ is of size $(n_1,n_0)$ and feature matrix X is of size $(m,n_0)$. So feature matrix need to be transposed before performing the dot product. The resulting $Z^1$ is of size $(n_1,m)$. The activation matrix $A^1$ is calculated by applying the activation function to each element of the $Z^1$ matrix so it has the same dimensions. For the next layer the linear combination matrix $Z^2$ is calculated using $A^1$, weight matrix $W_2$ and the bias vector $b_2$. The activation matrix $A^2$ is calculated by using the activation function for the layer. This transformation again changes the dimensions and the value of incoming data. This process is continued until the last layer with the prediction of the probability of binary class label using the sigmoid activation function. "
